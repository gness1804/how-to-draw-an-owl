##How to Draw an Owl - A Workshop for Verou Posse, Turing School

This is a workshop on the basics of HTML5 Canvas, a popular tool for using JavaScript to draw objects. Many of you may have used, or will use, Canvas in Game Time, but this is a deeper dive into the technology. Today, we'll draw an owl -- turning that classic Turing metaphor into a bona fide image on screen!

There are two branches in this repo, aside from master: `starter-branch` and `finished-branch`. After cloning down this repo, if you would like to code along, then checkout `starter-branch`, which contains only the bare-bones tools to get started. If you would rather just pay attention without worrying about all that typing, then you can checkout `finished-branch`, whose name is pretty self-explanatory.

Good news! No webpack or npm config are necessary here. This repo uses a vanilla file structure with just an html file, css file, and two JavaScript files, only one of which we'll really be using.

###Tl;dr instructions:

* Clone down this repo.
* Checkout either the `starter-branch` or the `finished-branch`.
* Do coding!
